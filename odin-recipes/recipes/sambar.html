    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups Basmati rice thoroughly rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger and garlic</li>
        <li>1 large onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon garam masala,chilli powder,cumin powder</li>
        <li>400 gms paneer cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup fried onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice with the spices and salt till all the water evaporates and the rice is about halfway done.
            Spread it out
            on a large platter so that the grains do not clump and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add in paneer and tomatoes and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes till the paneer is nicely coated with all the
            spices. Do not
            cook the tomatoes for too long since we want them to retain their shape and not give out too much moisture.
            This should
            be fairly thick and the paneer pieces should be well coated with the spice paste.</li>
        <li>Spread about half the paneer mix at the bottom of the pot. Then layer over with half of the pre-cooked rice,
            and top
            that with half the amounts of the cilantro, mint and fried onions.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the rose water on top, and cook covered on low heat for 10-15 minutes till the rice is completely
            cooked
            through. Serve warm with a side of Raita.</li>

    </ol>
